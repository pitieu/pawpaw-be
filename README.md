### Setup

create db folder for macOS catalyna
`sudo mkdir -p /System/Volumes/Data/data/db`
`sudo chown -R 'id -un' /System/Volumes/Data/data/db`

### To run the app

run
`npm install`

and then

run `npm run dev`

### Run Mongodb

Mongodb can be run as replica depending on what we comment out in `startdb.sh`

To run db you can run with

`sudo mongod --dbpath=/System/Volumes/Data/data/db`

Or

`./startdb.sh`

When DB is empty and we run the nodejs api, the populate data will fail so it needs to rerun again. (only happens once)

### Stop Mongodb in docker

`docker stop mongo1`
